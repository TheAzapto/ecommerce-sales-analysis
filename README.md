# E-Commerce Sales Insights Dashboard using Python

**Project overview**  
This project analyzes transactional e-commerce data (Online Retail / Online Retail II) to build an analysis notebook and an insights dashboard-style report. The goal is to clean the data, explore sales & customer behavior, generate business insights, and optionally perform clustering for customer segmentation and simple forecasting of future sales.

**Dataset (you must download and place into `data/`)**  
- Source: Online Retail / Online Retail II (transactions from a UK-based online store, 2009–2011). This dataset contains invoice-level transactions, product descriptions, quantities, unit prices, customer IDs and countries. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Dataset file (place inside `data/`):**  
- `online_retail_II.xlsx` or `online_retail.csv` (some Kaggle copies use CSV). The notebook will try to load either.

**Goals & objectives**
- Clean and preprocess transactional sales data.
- Perform EDA: summary statistics, product/category and country breakdowns, time series trends, correlation analysis.
- Extract business insights: top-selling products/categories, seasonality, revenue drivers, customer purchasing patterns.
- Demonstrate basic modeling: customer clustering (RFM + KMeans) and a simple sales forecasting baseline (linear regression on monthly sales).
- Produce visuals that could be used in a dashboard (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, distributions).

**Skills demonstrated**
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series aggregation & visualization
- Simple unsupervised learning (KMeans) and forecasting (scikit-learn regression)
- Project structuring for GitHub
